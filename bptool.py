"""
This module provides routines for computing the winning probabilities
for various candidates, given audit sample data, using a Bayesian
model, in a ballot-polling audit of a plurality election.  The
election may be single-jurisdiction or multi-jurisdiction.  In this
module we call a jurisdiction a "county" for convenience, although it
may be a precinct or a state or something else, as long as you can
sample from its collection of paper ballots.

The Bayesian model uses a prior pseudocount of "+1" for each candidate.

If this module is imported, rather than used stand-alone, then the procedure
    compute_win_probs
can compute the desired probability of each candidate winning a full recount,
given sample tallies for each county.

For command-line usage, there are really two modes:

(1) For single-county usage, give a command like:
        python bptool.py 10000 60 50 30
    where
        10000 is the total number of votes cast in the county
        60 50 30  are the votes seen for each candidate in the auditing so far

(2) For multiple-county usage, give a command like
        python bptool.py --path_to_csv test.csv
    where test.csv is a file like:
        county name, total votes, Alice, Bob
        1, 1000, 30, 15
        2, 2000, 40, 50
    with one header line, then one line per county.  The field names
    "county name" and "total votes" are required; the candidate names are
    the candidate names for the contest being audited.

There are optional parameters as well, to see the documentation of them, do
    python bptool.py --h
